AI_answer(inheritance):
**Intermidiate reasoning results:**

1. **Identify possible inheritances:**
   - Member, Treasurer, and Secretary are all roles a Person can take in the yacht club system, suggesting that they could inherit from a UserRole or similar role class.
   - Boat could potentially be a subclass of a more general BoatType, but BoatType is not provided in the classes.
   - MembershipPayment is related to Member but does not inherit from it.
   - BerthInformation is related to both Member and Boat but does not inherit from them.
   - CalendarEvent, PaymentTransaction, BoatRegistrationInformation, TaxAuthority, and Municipality do not clearly indicate inheritance relationships with the other provided classes.

2. **Evaluating potential inheritances:**
   + Member extends Person because a Member "is-a-kind-of" Person.
   + Treasurer extends Person because a Treasurer "is-a-kind-of" Person.
   + Secretary extends Person because a Secretary "is-a-kind-of" Person.
   + Boat does not extend from any class because it does not have a parent class to inherit from in the provided classes.
   + MembershipPayment does not extend Member because it represents a payment mechanism rather than a role or type of person.
   + BerthInformation does not extend Member or Boat because it is an information class, not a role or type.
   + CalendarEvent does not extend any provided class because it is a standalone entity for managing calendar events.
   + PaymentTransaction does not extend any provided class for the same reason as CalendarEvent.
   + BoatRegistrationInformation does not extend any provided class for the same reason as CalendarEvent and PaymentTransaction.
   + TaxAuthority does not extend any provided class as it represents an external authority.
   + Municipality does not extend any provided class as it represents an external entity.

3. **Checking for incorrect inheritances:**
   - All identified inheritances seem logical based on the provided information about roles.
   - No incorrect inheritances are present to delete in this context.

   + Member extends Person because a Member is-a-kind-of Person.
   + Treasurer extends Person because a Treasurer is-a-kind-of Person.
   + Secretary extends Person because a Secretary is-a-kind-of Person.
   + Boat does not extend Berth because a Boat is not-a-kind-of Berth; rather, a Boat can be assigned to a Berth.
   + CalendarEvent does not extend Person because a CalendarEvent is not-a-kind-of Person; it is an event rather than a person.
   + Payment does not extend Person because a Payment is not-a-kind-of Person; it represents a financial transaction.
