AI_answer(association):
```
Final Association Relationships:
   + [1] User associate [0..*] Leave because employees can request leave and have leave information.
   + [1] Employee associate [0..*] Leave because employees can request leave and have leave information.
   + [1] Employee associate [0..*] Punishment because employees can commit offenses and receive punishments.
   + [1] Administrator associate [0..*] User because administrators manage user logins.

Final Composition Relationships:
   + [1] User contain [0..*] Employee because users can be employees.
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI_answer(inheritance):

# Intermdiate reasoning results
   + User extends Employee because an Employee includes information such as name, address, and other personal details which are relevant to a User.
   + Administrator does not extend User because an Administrator is a distinct role with different responsibilities compared to a regular User.
   + Leave does not extend Employee because Leave is a separate entity that is associated with an Employee but is not a kind of Employee.
   + Punishment does not extend Employee because Punishment is a separate entity that is associated with an Employee but is not a kind of Employee.

```
Final Inheritance Relationships:
   + User extends Employee
