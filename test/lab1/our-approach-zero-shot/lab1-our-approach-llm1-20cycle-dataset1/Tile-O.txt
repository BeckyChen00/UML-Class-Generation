AI_answer(association):
Based on the provided description and given classes, here are the Association and Composition relationships:

```
Final Association Relationships:
   + [1] Game associate [1] GameDesigner because a game is designed by a game designer.
   + [1] Game associate [0..*] Player because a game can have multiple players.
   + [1] GameDesigner associate [1] GameBoardLayout because a game designer defines the layout of the game board.
   + [1] GameBoardLayout associate [1..4] PlayerStartingPosition because it indicates the starting positions of players.
   + [1] GameBoardLayout associate [1] HiddenTile because it indicates the location of the hidden tile.
   + [1] GameBoardLayout associate [1..32] ActionTile because it defines the location of action tiles.
   + [1] GameBoardLayout associate [1] ActionCardDeck because it defines the deck of action cards.
   + [1] Player associate [1] PlayingPiece because each player has a playing piece.
   + [1] ActionTile associate [1] ActionCard because an action tile has an associated action card.

Final Composition Relationships:
   + [1] Game contain [1] GameBoardLayout because a game contains the layout of the game board.
   + [1] Game contain [1] ActionCardDeck because a game contains the deck of action cards.
   + [1] Player contain [1] PlayingPiece because each player has a playing piece.
```

These relationships are based on the understanding that association signifies a relationship between classes where one class is connected to another, and composition signifies a relationship where one class contains another as a part of its structure.
