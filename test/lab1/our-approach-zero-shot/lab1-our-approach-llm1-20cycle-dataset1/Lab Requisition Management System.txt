Based on the system functional requirements provided in the description, I have identified the following enumerations, classes, and attributes:

## Enumerations:
1. **RepetitionInterval**(weekly, monthly, half_yearly, yearly)

## Classes:
1. **Doctor**
2. **Patient**
3. **Lab**
4. **Test**
5. **Requisition**
6. **Appointment**
7. **LabTestGroup**

## Attributes:
1. **Doctor**(practitioner_number: numeric, full_name: string, address: string, phone_number: string, digital_signature: image)
2. **Patient**(health_number: alpha-numeric, first_name: string, last_name: string, date_of_birth: date, address: string, phone_number: string)
3. **Lab**(address: string, business_hours: string, registration_number: string, fee: decimal)
4. **Test**(name: string, duration: time)
5. **Requisition**(doctor: Doctor, patient: Patient, tests: List<Test>, repetition_times: integer, repetition_interval: RepetitionInterval)
6. **Appointment**(confirmation_number: string, date: date, start_time: time, end_time: time, lab: Lab)
7. **LabTestGroup**(name: string)

This breakdown should help in structuring the system's classes and attributes effectively based on the functional requirements provided.

Intermidiate reasoning results:
   - Doctor has a numeric practitioner number, full name, address, phone number, and digital signature.
   - Requisition includes doctor's information, patient's information, and date of validity.
   - Requisition can have multiple tests from the same group.
   - Test has a duration defined by the lab network and can be repeated with a specified interval.
   - Doctor and patient can view test results and reports.
   - Patient makes appointments based on lab's address and business hours.
   - Appointment includes confirmation number, date, start/end times, lab name, and registration number.
   - Lab determines fees and business hours.

Final Association Relationships:
   + [1] Doctor associate [0..*] Requisition because a doctor can create multiple requisitions.
   + [1] Patient associate [0..*] Requisition because a patient can have multiple requisitions.
   + [1] Test associate [1..*] Requisition because a requisition can have multiple tests.
   + [1] Lab associate [1..*] Appointment because a lab can have multiple appointments.
   + [1] LabTestGroup associate [1..*] Test because a test belongs to a specific group of tests.

Final Composition Relationships:
   + [1] Requisition contain [1] Doctor because a requisition must include the doctor's information.
   + [1] Requisition contain [1] Patient because a requisition must include the patient's information.
   + [1] Appointment contain [1] Lab because an appointment must be made at a specific lab.
