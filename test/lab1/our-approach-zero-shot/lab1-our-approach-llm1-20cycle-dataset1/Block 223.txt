AI_answer(inheritance):
### Intermediate reasoning results:
   + No inheritances identified yet.

### Step 1:
Based on the provided description and classes, let's identify potential inheritances based on the "is-a-kind-of" relationship.

1. **User extends Player** because a User is always a player.
2. **Player extends User** does not make sense as a Player is not a type of User.
3. **Admin extends User** because an Admin is a type of User.

Therefore, we have:
   + User extends Player because a User is always a player.
   + Admin extends User because an Admin is a type of User.

### Final Inheritance Relationships:
   + User extends Player
   + Admin extends User
