### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Associations**:
   - + [1..*] Student associate [0..*] Project because a student can be assigned to one or multiple projects.
   - + [0..*] Project associate [1..*] Student because each project can be assigned to one or multiple students.

2. **Compositions**:
   - + [1] Project contain [1] Project because each project has specific details that are essential and cannot exist without the project itself (attributes like start date, deadline, etc. are part of the project).

3. **Inheritances**:
   - + UndergraduateStudent extends Student because an undergraduate student is a kind of student.
   - + GraduateStudent extends Student because a graduate student is a kind of student.

4. **Redundant associations or incorrect inheritances**:
   - + Project does not extend Student because Project is a different entity and is not a kind of Student, delete this inheritance.
   - The associations are already defined correctly without redundancy.

### Intermediate reasoning results
1. **Associations**:
   - A `Student` is associated with one or more `Project` instances, as a project is assigned to a student.
   + [1] [Student] associate [0..*] [Project] because a student can be assigned multiple projects.

2. **Compositions**:
   - Since a `Project` is defined by its attributes (title, description, start date, deadline, and grade), we can consider that a `Project` contains all these attributes.
   + [1] [Project] contain [1] [String title] because a project has exactly one title.
   + [1] [Project] contain [1] [String description] because a project has exactly one description.
   + [1] [Project] contain [1] [Date startDate] because a project has exactly one start date.
   + [1] [Project] contain [1] [Date deadline] because a project has exactly one deadline.
   + [1] [Project] contain [1] [String grade] because a project has exactly one grade.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - `UndergraduateStudent` and `GraduateStudent` are both types of `Student`.
   + [UndergraduateStudent] extends [Student] because an undergraduate student is a kind of student.
   + [GraduateStudent] extends [Student] because a graduate student is a kind of student.

4. **Invalid Inheritances**:
   - There are no invalid inheritances to delete in this case, as all classes properly reflect a hierarchical relationship.

   + [1..*] Student associate [1..*] Project because a project management system assigns one or multiple projects to students.
   + [1] UndergraduateStudent associate [1] Project because undergraduate students can work on projects.
   + [1] GraduateStudent associate [1] Project because graduate students can also work on projects.

2. **Identifying Compositions:**
   + [1] Project contain [0..*] Student because a project can have multiple students associated with it.
   + [1] Student contain [0..*] Project because a student can be assigned to multiple projects.

3. **Identifying Inheritances:**
   + UndergraduateStudent extends Student because an undergraduate student is a kind of student.
   + GraduateStudent extends Student because a graduate student is a kind of student.

4. **Checking for Redundant Associations and Inheritances:**
   + We do not have redundant associations or incorrect inheritances based on the definitions provided.

### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Associations**:
   + [1..*] Student associate [0..*] Project because a project management system assigns one or multiple projects to students, indicating that each student can be associated with multiple projects and each project can be assigned to multiple students.
   + [1..*] UndergraduateStudent associate [0..*] Project because undergraduate students can also be assigned to multiple projects.
   + [1..*] GraduateStudent associate [0..*] Project because graduate students can also be assigned to multiple projects.

2. **Compositions**:
   + [1] Project contain [1] UndergraduateStudent because each project is directly associated with at least one undergraduate student.
   + [1] Project contain [1] GraduateStudent because each project is directly associated with at least one graduate student.
   + (Note: The composition relationships here are more ambiguous and can be interpreted differently depending on the context of the project management system. Typically, projects are not part of students; thus, this might not strictly hold true.)

3. **Inheritance**:
   + UndergraduateStudent extends Student because an undergraduate student is a kind of student.
   + GraduateStudent extends Student because a graduate student is a kind of student.

4. **Verification of Inheritances**:
   + Student does not extend UndergraduateStudent because Student is a parent class and not a derived class.
   + Student does not extend GraduateStudent for the same reason as above.
