### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Associations:**
   - The `Person` class is associated with the `Role` class because a person can have different roles (e.g., chair, reviewer, author).
   - The `Reviewer` class is associated with the `Paper` class because a reviewer reviews one or more papers.
   - The `Author` class is associated with the `Paper` class because authors can submit multiple papers.
   - The `Chair` class is associated with the `Paper` class because the chair makes a final decision on each paper.
   - The `Review` class is associated with both the `Reviewer` and `Paper` classes because a review is written by a reviewer for a specific paper.

2. **Compositions:**
   - The `Paper` class contains `Review` because a paper is reviewed by multiple reviews.
   - The `Role` class could contain `Person`, since a role is assigned to a specific person.

3. **Inheritance:**
   - The `Chair` class extends the `Role` class because a chair is a specific type of role.
   - The `Reviewer` class extends the `Role` class because a reviewer is also a type of role.
   - The `Author` class extends the `Role` class because an author is a type of role.

4. **Checking for Redundancies and Incorrect Inheritances:**
   - No redundant bidirectional associations were found.
   - All inheritance relationships are valid based on the taxonomy of roles.

+ [1] Review associate [1] Paper because each review corresponds to one paper.

**Final Composition Relationships:**
+ [1] Paper contain [0..*] Review because a paper can have multiple reviews.

**Final Inheritance Relationships:**
+ [Chair] extends [Role] because a chair is a kind of role.
+ [Reviewer] extends [Role] because a reviewer is a kind of role.

### Intermidiate reasoning results
1. The **Person** class represents a user with a name, which implies that **Role**, **Reviewer**, **Author**, and **Chair** might be associated with **Person** because they define specific roles that a person can take in the review system.
2. The **Paper** class has attributes for decision, title, and type, and it is associated with **Review** because a paper can have multiple reviews.
3. The **Role** class is generic and has a Boolean attribute indicating if the person is a chair, which suggests that it might have an association with **Person**.
4. The **Review** class has a grade and feedback, and it is associated with **Paper** because every review corresponds to a specific paper.
5. The **Chair** class extends the **Role** class, as a chair is a specific type of role.
6. The **Reviewer** and **Author** classes likely extend from **Role** since both are specific roles that a person can have.
7. Since the **Chair** is a specific type of **Role**, we can conclude that **Chair** extends **Role**.
8. The **Reviewer** and **Author** classes are also specific types of **Role** and should extend it.
9. **Person** does not extend **Role**, **Reviewer**, or **Author**, as it is a separate entity that represents a user.

#### Final Association Relationships

3. + [0..*] Role associate [1] Author because a role can be assigned to multiple authors, and each author is associated with a role.
4. + [1] Paper associate [0..*] Review because a paper can have multiple reviews.
5. + [0..*] Reviewer associate [0..*] Paper because a reviewer can review multiple papers, and each paper can be reviewed by multiple reviewers.

### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Associations**:
   + [1] Person associate [0..*] Role because a person can have one role (e.g., chair, author, reviewer) but a role can be associated with multiple persons.
   + [1] Author associate [0..*] Paper because an author can submit multiple papers, but a paper is associated with at least one author (the one who submits it).
   + [1] Reviewer associate [0..*] Review because a reviewer can submit multiple reviews for different papers, but each review is associated with one specific reviewer.
   + [1] Chair associate [0..*] Paper because a chair makes decisions on multiple papers, but each paper is ultimately associated with one chair for its final decision.
   + [1] Paper associate [0..*] Review because a paper can have multiple reviews from different reviewers.

2. **Compositions**:
   + [1] Paper contain [1..*] Review because each paper must have at least three reviews (as stated in the description).
   + [1] Review contain [1] DecisionKind because each review must have a decision associated with it (Accept or Reject).
   + [1] Paper contain [1] PaperType because each paper has exactly one type (research or experience report).

3. **Inheritances**:
   + Role extends Person because a Role is a specific classification of a Person (chair, reviewer, author).
   + Reviewer extends Role because a Reviewer is a specific kind of Role.
   + Author extends Role because an Author is also a specific kind of Role.
   + Chair extends Role because a Chair is also a specific kind of Role.
   + Paper extends Review because a Paper can be seen as a more complex type of Review, but this is not correct because they serve different purposes and should not extend from one another. Therefore, delete this inheritance.
   + DecisionKind does not extend PaperType because they are distinct types used within the Paper and Review classes, delete this inheritance.
