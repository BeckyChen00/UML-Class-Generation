### Intermediate Reasoning Results:

1. **Associations**:
   - **Company and Department**: 
     + [1] Company associate [2..8] Department because a company can have multiple departments (from 2 to 8).
   - **Department and Employee**: 
     + [0..*] Department associate [0..*] Employee because a department can hire zero or more employees.
   - **Employee and Project**: 
     + [0..*] Employee associate [0..*] Project because an employee can work on multiple projects, and a project can have multiple employees.
   - **Project and Funding Group**: 
     + [0..1] Project associate [1] FundingGroup because education and community projects are associated with one funding group, while production and research projects are not necessarily associated.
   - **EducationProject and FundingGroup**: 
     + [1] EducationProject associate [1] FundingGroup because each education project must have one funding group.
   - **CommunityProject and FundingGroup**: 
     + [1] CommunityProject associate [1] FundingGroup because each community project must have one funding group.
   - **ProductionProject and Project**: 
     + [1] ProductionProject associate [1] Project because a production project is a specific type of project and must have project attributes (title, description, budget, deadline).
   - **ResearchProject and Project**: 
     + [1] ResearchProject associate [1] Project because a research project is a specific type of project and must have project attributes (title, description, budget, deadline).
   - **EducationProject and Project**:

   - **CommunityProject and Project**: 
     + [1] CommunityProject associate [1] Project because a community project is a specific type of project and must have project attributes (title, description, budget, deadline).

2. **Compositions**:
   - **Department and Employee**:
     + [1] Department contain [0..*] Employee because employees are hired by a department and cannot exist without it.
   - **Project and Employee**: 
     + [0..*] Project contain [0..*] Employee because projects can have multiple employees working on them, though an employee can exist outside the context of a project, hence it is not a strict composition.
   - **FundingGroup and EducationProject**:
     + [1] FundingGroup contain [1] EducationProject because an education project is associated with exactly one funding group which could be seen as a part of the project for funding purposes.
   - **FundingGroup and CommunityProject**:
     + [1] FundingGroup contain [1] CommunityProject because a community project is associated with exactly one funding group which could be seen as a part of the project for funding purposes.

3. **Inheritances**:
   - **ProductionProject** extends **Project** because a production project is a kind of project with specific attributes (site code).
   - **EducationProject** extends **Project** because an education project is a kind of project with specific attributes.
   - **ResearchProject** extends **Project** because a research project is a kind of project with specific attributes.
   - **CommunityProject** extends **Project** because a community project is a kind of project with specific attributes.
   - **Employee** does not extend **ProductionProject** because it is a separate entity associated with projects, not a specific type of project, delete this inheritance.
   - **Employee** does not extend **EducationProject** because it is a separate entity associated with projects, not a specific type of project, delete this inheritance.
   - **Employee** does not extend **ResearchProject** because it is a separate entity associated with projects, not a specific type of project, delete this inheritance.
   - **Employee** does not extend **CommunityProject** because it is a separate entity associated with projects, not a specific type of project, delete this inheritance.
   - **FundingGroup** does not extend **Project** because it represents a different concept that is associated with projects, not a specific type of project, delete this inheritance.

1. **Associations**:
   - + [1..*] Company associate [2..8] Department because a company can have multiple departments, and each department belongs to exactly one company.
   - + [1..*] Department associate [0..*] Employee because a department can hire multiple employees, but an employee may not be assigned to a department.
   - + [1..*] Project associate [0..*] Employee because a project can involve multiple employees, but an employee can work on multiple projects.
   - + [1..*] Project associate [0..1] FundingGroup because some projects (specifically education and community projects) are associated with one funding group.
   - + [1] ProductionProject associate [0..1] FundingGroup because production projects do not require a funding group.
   - + [1] EducationProject associate [1] FundingGroup because education projects are associated with exactly one funding group.
   - + [1] CommunityProject associate [1] FundingGroup because community projects are associated with exactly one funding group.

2. **Compositions**:
   - + [1] Company contain [2..8] Department because a company is composed of multiple departments.
   - + [1] Department contain [0..*] Employee because a department contains multiple employees for its projects.
   - + [1] Project contain [0..*] Employee because a project can include multiple employees who work on it.

3. **Inheritances**:
   - + [ProductionProject] extends [Project] because a production project is a specific type of project.
   - + [EducationProject] extends [Project] because an education project is a specific type of project.
   - + [ResearchProject] extends [Project] because a research project is a specific type of project.
   - + [CommunityProject] extends [Project] because a community project is a specific type of project.

   - + [FundingGroup] extends [MixedGroup] because a mixed group is a type of funding group.

4. **Non-inheritances**:
   - + [TemporaryEmployee] does not extend [Employee] because they are both types of employees, but not in a superclass-subclass relationship; they are more like siblings in the hierarchy.
   - + [PermanentEmployee] does not extend [Employee] for the same reason as above.
   - + [FundingGroup] does not extend [GroupType] because it is an instance of funding groups, not a type of group. Delete this inheritance.

### Intermediate reasoning results

1. **Associations**:
   - + [1] Company associate [2..8] Department because a company can have multiple departments (between 2 and 8).
   - + [1] Department associate [0..*] Employee because a department hires multiple employees.
   - + [0..*] Project associate [0..*] Employee because employees work on multiple projects and projects can have multiple employees.
   - + [1] EducationProject associate [1] FundingGroup because each education project is associated with one funding group.
   - + [1] CommunityProject associate [1] FundingGroup because each community project is associated with one funding group.
   - + [1] ProductionProject associate [0..*] Project because production projects are a specific type of project.

2. **Compositions**:
   - + [1] Company contain [2..8] Department because the existence of departments is dependent on a company, indicating a composition relationship.
   - + [1] Department contain [0..*] Employee because employees are part of a department.
   - + [1] Project contain [0..*] Employee because employees are part of projects.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - + [ProductionProject] extends [Project] because a production project is a specific type of project.
   - + [EducationProject] extends [Project] because an education project is a specific type of project.
   - + [ResearchProject] extends [Project] because a research project is a specific type of project.
   - + [CommunityProject] extends [Project] because a community project is a specific type of project.
   - + [Employee] extends [EmployeeType] because an employee is a specific type of employee categorized by type.

### Final Association Relationships:
- + [1] Company associate [2..8] Department
- + [1] Department associate [0..*] Employee
- + [0..*] Project associate [0..*] Employee
- + [1] EducationProject associate [1] FundingGroup
- + [1] CommunityProject associate [1] FundingGroup
- + [1] ProductionProject associate [0..*] Project

### Final Composition Relationships:
- + [1] Company contain [2..8] Department
- + [1] Department contain [0..*] Employee
- + [1] Project contain [0..*] Employee

### Final Inheritance Relationships:
- + [ProductionProject] extends [Project]
- + [EducationProject] extends [Project]
- + [ResearchProject] extends [Project]
- + [CommunityProject] extends [Project]
- + [Employee] extends [EmployeeType] 

Note: The class `EmployeeType` was not explicitly mentioned in the provided classes, so the inheritance from `EmployeeType` is incorrect and should be deleted. Thus, we only keep the relationships that make sense with the provided classes. 

Final Inheritance Relationships corrected:
- + [ProductionProject] extends [Project]
- + [EducationProject] extends [Project]
- + [ResearchProject] extends [Project]
- + [CommunityProject] extends [Project] 

This also reflects the taxonomy where all specialized project types are a kind of project.
