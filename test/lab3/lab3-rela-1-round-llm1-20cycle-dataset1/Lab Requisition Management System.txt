   - A `Requisition` is associated with multiple `Appointment` entries because a requisition may lead to multiple appointments if tests are repeated.
   - An `Appointment` is associated with a `Lab` because appointments are made at specific labs.
   - A `Lab` is associated with multiple `BusinessHour` entries because a lab has defined business hours for different days of the week.
   - A `Test` is associated with a `TestResult` because each test has results that can be either negative or positive.

2. **Compositions:**
   - A `Requisition` contains a `Doctor` because the requisition has details of the doctor who prescribed it.
   - A `Requisition` contains a `Patient` because the requisition has details of the patient for whom it is created.
   - A `Lab` contains multiple `Test` entries because a lab offers various tests.
   - A `Lab` contains multiple `BusinessHour` entries because a lab has defined business hours for its operations.

   - `Patient` extends `Person` because a patient is a specific type of person with additional attributes (like date of birth).
   - `Doctor` extends `Person` because a doctor is also a specific type of person with additional attributes (like a signature).
   - `PersonRole` does not extend `Person` because it represents a role rather than a specific type of person, delete this inheritance.
   - `SpecificTest` extends `Test` because a specific test is a kind of test with additional data (like the date).
   - `TestType` does not extend `Test` because it represents a classification of tests rather than a specific test, delete this inheritance.

   - **Doctor and Requisition**: A doctor can create a requisition. Therefore, a [1] Doctor associates [0..*] Requisition because a doctor can make multiple requisitions for tests.
   - **Patient and Requisition**: A requisition contains patient information. Therefore, a [1] Patient associates [0..*] Requisition because a patient can have multiple requisitions.
   - **Requisition and Test**: A requisition can contain multiple tests. Therefore, a [1] Requisition associates [0..*] Test because a requisition can include several tests.
   - **Patient and Appointment**: A patient makes appointments for tests. Therefore, a [1] Patient associates [0..*] Appointment because a patient can schedule multiple appointments.
   - **Appointment and Lab**: An appointment is made for a specific lab. Therefore, a [1] Appointment associates [1] Lab because an appointment is tied to one lab.
   - **Lab and BusinessHour**: A lab has defined business hours. Therefore, a [1] Lab associates [0..*] BusinessHour because a lab can have business hours for each day of the week.
   - **Requisition and TestResult**: Each requisition can have associated test results. Therefore, a [1] Requisition associates [0..*] TestResult because multiple results may arise from tests on a requisition.
   - **Doctor and Patient**: A doctor can provide services to patients. Therefore, a [1] Doctor associates [0..*] Patient because a doctor can have multiple patients.

1. **Associations**:
   - A **Doctor** is associated with a **Patient** because a doctor can prescribe tests for a patient.
   - A **Requisition** is associated with a **Doctor** because the requisition must be created by a doctor.
   - A **Requisition** is associated with a **Patient** because the requisition must include patient information.
   - A **Requisition** is associated with one or more **Tests** since several tests can be combined on it.
   - A **Patient** is associated with an **Appointment** because patients make appointments for tests.
   - An **Appointment** is associated with a **Lab** because patients select labs for their appointments.
   - A **Test** is associated with a **TestResult** because tests yield results.
   - A **Test** is associated with a **TestType** because each test is of a specific type.
   - A **Lab** is associated with **BusinessHours** because labs have specific business hours during which they operate.

2. **Compositions**:
   - A **Requisition** contains **Tests** because the requisition can include multiple tests as part of its details.
   - An **Appointment** contains a **Lab** because each appointment is specifically for a lab.
   - A **Lab** contains **BusinessHours** because a lab has defined business hours.

3. **Inheritances**:
   - **Patient** extends **Person** because a patient is a type of person.
   - **Doctor** extends **Person** because a doctor is a type of person.
   - **PersonRole** could be seen as a role related to a **Person**, but it does not extend from **Person** so it is not considered an inheritance.
   - **Requisition** does not extend from any class since it is a unique entity in this context.
   - **Test** does not extend from any class since it is also a unique entity.
   - **SpecificTest** does not extend from any class since it is a unique entity.
   - **Appointment** does not extend from any class since it is a unique entity.
   - **Lab** does not extend from any class since it is also a unique entity.
   - **TestResult** does not extend from any class since it is also a unique entity.
   - **TestType** does not extend from any class since it is also a unique entity.

### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Associations:**
   - A `Doctor` manages a `Requisition`, which means a `Doctor` can create multiple `Requisitions`. Therefore, we have:
     + [1] Doctor associate [0..*] Requisition because a doctor can create zero or many requisitions.
   - A `Requisition` is associated with a `Patient`, as it contains patient information. Thus:
     + [1] Requisition associate [1] Patient because each requisition must be linked to exactly one patient.
   - A `Patient` can make multiple `Appointments`, but each appointment relates to one patient:
     + [1] Patient associate [0..*] Appointment because a patient can have zero or many appointments.
   - A `Test` can be part of multiple `Requisitions`, and each requisition can contain multiple tests:
     + [0..*] Test associate [0..*] Requisition because multiple tests can be included in requisitions and vice versa.
   - A `Requisition` can have multiple `TestResults`, as each requisition can contain tests whose results need to be recorded:
     + [0..*] TestResult associate [1] Requisition because a requisition can have zero or more test results.
   - A `Lab` can have multiple `Appointments`, as patients make appointments at labs:
     + [1] Lab associate [0..*] Appointment because a lab can handle multiple appointments.
   - A `TestType` can be associated with multiple `Tests`, as each type can include various tests:
     + [1] TestType associate [0..*] Test because a test type can have zero or many tests.

2. **Compositions:**
   - A `Requisition` contains a `Doctor` and a `Patient`, meaning both are integral to the requisition:
     + [1] Requisition contain [1] Doctor because a requisition must have one doctor.
     + [1] Requisition contain [1] Patient because a requisition must have one patient.
   - An `Appointment` is part of a `Lab`, as each appointment is for a specific lab:
     + [1] Appointment contain [1] Lab because each appointment must be linked to one lab.

3. **Inheritances:**
   - `Patient` extends `Person` because a patient is a type of person:
     + Patient extends Person because a patient is-a-kind-of person.
   - `Doctor` extends `Person` because a doctor is also a type of person:
     + Doctor extends Person because a doctor is-a-kind-of person.
   - `Requisition` does not extend `Doctor` or `Patient` because it is a distinct entity that contains references to both. Therefore, we will not have any inheritance here:
     + Requisition does not extend Doctor because Requisition is-a-part-of Doctor, delete this inheritance.
     + Requisition does not extend Patient because Requisition is-a-part-of Patient, delete this inheritance.
   - `TestResult` does not extend `Test` because it represents the result of a test rather than being a type of test:
     + TestResult does not extend Test because TestResult is-a-part-of Test, delete this inheritance.
   - `SpecificTest` does not extend `Test` but rather represents a specific instance of a test:
     + SpecificTest does not extend Test because SpecificTest is-a-part-of Test, delete this inheritance.
   - `Appointment` does not extend `Requisition` as it serves a different purpose:
     + Appointment does not extend Requisition because Appointment is-a-part-of Requisition, delete this inheritance.

1. **Association Relationships**
   + [1] Doctor associate [0..*] Requisition because a doctor can create many requisitions but a requisition is created by one doctor.
   + [1] Patient associate [0..*] Requisition because a patient can have many requisitions but a requisition is associated with one patient.
   + [1] Requisition associate [0..*] SpecificTest because a requisition can include multiple specific tests.
   + [1] SpecificTest associate [1] Test because each specific test corresponds to one test type but a test type can have multiple specific tests.
   + [1] Appointment associate [0..1] Requisition because an appointment may correspond to a requisition (if needed) but a requisition can exist without an appointment.
   + [1] Lab associate [0..*] Appointment because a lab can have multiple appointments but an appointment is made for one lab.
   + [1] Lab associate [0..*] Test because a lab can perform many tests and tests are available at multiple labs.
   + [1] Doctor associate [0..*] TestResult because a doctor can view multiple test results.
   + [1] Patient associate [0..*] TestResult because a patient can receive multiple test results.

2. **Composition Relationships**
   + [1] Requisition contain [1..*] Test because a requisition consists of one or more tests.
   + [1] Lab contain [1..*] BusinessHour because a lab operates during its business hours.
   + [1] Appointment contain [1] Patient because an appointment is specifically for one patient.
   + [1] Appointment contain [1] Lab because each appointment is linked to a specific lab.
   + [1] Appointment contain [1] Requisition because an appointment can be made for a requisition.

3. **Inheritance Relationships**
   + Patient extends Person because a patient is a specific type of person.
   + Doctor extends Person because a doctor is a specific type of person.
   + PersonRole extends Person because a person role is a classification of a person.
   + Requisition extends Test because a requisition is a specific kind of test request.
   + Test extends TestType because a test is a specific instance of a test type.

4. **Invalid Inheritance**
   + Lab does not extend BusinessHour because a lab has business hours, but it is not a type of business hour, delete this inheritance.
   + TestType does not extend Test because a test type categorizes tests but is not a test itself, delete this inheritance.
