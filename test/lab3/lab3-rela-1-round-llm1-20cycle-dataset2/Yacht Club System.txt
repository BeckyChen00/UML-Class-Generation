   - Secretary is associated with Berths since the Secretary manages the booking of berths.
   - Treasurer is associated with Members since the Treasurer manages payment statuses and invoices for members.

### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Associations:**
   - + [1] `YachtClubSystem` associate [0..*] `User` because a yacht club system manages multiple users (members, treasurer, secretary) who can log in.
   - + [1] `User` associate [1] `Member` because a user can specifically be a member of the yacht club.
   - + [1] `User` associate [1] `Treasurer` because a user can specifically be a treasurer of the yacht club.
   - + [1] `User` associate [1] `Secretary` because a user can specifically be a secretary of the yacht club.
   - + [0..*] `Member` associate [0..*] `Boat` because a member can own multiple boats, and a boat can belong to one member.
   - + [1] `Member` associate [0..*] `Berth` because a member can have a berth assigned, which may or may not be booked.
   - + [0..*] `Secretary` associate [0..*] `Event` because the secretary manages multiple events in the club's calendar.
   - + [1] `Secretary` associate [1] `Calendar` because the secretary manages a single calendar for club events.
   - + [0..*] `Treasurer` associate [0..*] `Reminder` because the treasurer can send multiple reminders to members regarding payments.
   - + [1] `Member` associate [0..*] `Receipt` because a member can receive multiple receipts for different transactions.
   - + [0..*] `Member` associate [0..*] `Payment` because multiple payment records could be associated with a member's dues.
   - + [1] `Berth` associate [1] `Boat` because a berth can hold one boat at a time.
   - + [1] `Event` associate [1] `Calendar` because an event is scheduled within a specific calendar.

2. **Compositions:**
   - + [1] `YachtClubSystem` contain [1..*] `Member` because the yacht club system is composed of multiple members.
   - + [1] `Calendar` contain [0..*] `Event` because a calendar contains multiple events.
   - + [1] `Member` contain [0..*] `Boat` because a member registers and manages multiple boats.

3. **Inheritances:**
   - + `Member` extends `User` because a member is a specific type of user who has additional attributes related to membership.
   - + `Treasurer` extends `User` because a treasurer is a specific role that is a type of user.
   - + `Secretary` extends `User` because a secretary is a specific role that is a type of user.
   - + `Boat` extends `Receipt` because a boat could be involved in transactions that might generate receipts, though this may be a stretch in strict terms. This requires reevaluation.
   - + `Berth` does not extend `Boat` because a berth is a location that boats occupy, not a kind of boat; delete this inheritance.
   - + `Event` does not extend `Calendar` because an event is not a kind of calendar; delete this inheritance.

1. **Associations**:
   + [1] `User` associate [1] `Member` because a user can be a member of the yacht club.
   + [1] `Member` associate [0..*] `Boat` because a member can own one or more boats.
   + [1] `Member` associate [1] `Treasurer` because the treasurer manages payments for members.
   + [1] `Member` associate [1] `Secretary` because the secretary manages member data and berths.
   + [1] `Secretary` associate [1] `Berth` because the secretary manages berth bookings.
   + [0..*] `Berth` associate [1] `Boat` because each berth can be assigned to one boat.
   + [1] `Calendar` associate [0..*] `Event` because a calendar can contain multiple events.
   + [1] `Event` associate [1] `Secretary` because the secretary manages the calendar events.

2. **Compositions**:
   + [1] `Calendar` contain [0..*] `Event` because events are part of the calendar.
   + [1] `Member` contain [1..*] `Receipt` because each member can have multiple receipts related to payments.
   + [1] `Member` contain [1..*] `Reminder` because each member can receive reminders related to payment dues.
   + [1] `Boat` contain [1] `Berth` because a boat can be assigned to a specific berth when booked.

3. **Inheritance**:
   + `Member` extends `User` because a member is a kind of user in the yacht club system.
   + `Treasurer` extends `User` because a treasurer is also a kind of user in the yacht club system.
   + `Secretary` extends `User` because a secretary is also a kind of user in the yacht club system.
   + `BoatType` is not present in the given classes, thus it cannot extend or relate to other classes.

4. **Invalid Associations/Compositions**:
   + `User` does not extend `Member`, `Treasurer`, or `Secretary` directly, but they are all users. Thus, while they are associated, they do not inherit from each other directly.

   + [Reminder] does not extend [Receipt] because they serve different purposes; Reminder is about payment due, while Receipt is about transaction confirmation.
   + [Event] does not extend [Calendar] because an Event is contained within a Calendar rather than being a type of Calendar.

### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Association Relationships:**
   - + [1] `YachtClubSystem` associate [0..*] `User` because `User` represents individuals who interact with the `YachtClubSystem`.
   - + [0..*] `User` associate [0..*] `Member` because multiple `Users` can become `Members`, and a `Member` is a specific type of `User`.
   - + [0..*] `Member` associate [0..*] `Boat` because a `Member` can own multiple `Boats`, and each `Boat` belongs to one `Member`.
   - + [1] `Secretary` associate [0..*] `Berth` because the `Secretary` manages the booking status of multiple `Berths`.
   - + [0..*] `Secretary` associate [0..*] `Event` because the `Secretary` manages multiple `Events` in the `Calendar`.
   - + [0..*] `Treasurer` associate [0..*] `Member` because the `Treasurer` manages payments for multiple `Members`.
   - + [0..*] `Member` associate [0..*] `Reminder` because `Members` can receive multiple `Reminders` for dues.
   - + [0..*] `Member` associate [0..*] `Receipt` because `Members` can receive multiple `Receipts` upon payment.
   - + [0..*] `Boat` associate [1] `Berth` because each `Boat` can be assigned to one `Berth` when booked.
   - + [1] `Calendar` associate [0..*] `Event` because the `Calendar` can contain multiple `Events`.

2. **Composition Relationships:**
   - + [1] `YachtClubSystem` contain [1] `Calendar` because the `Calendar` is an integral part of the `YachtClubSystem`.
   - + [1] `Calendar` contain [0..*] `Event` because `Events` are a part of the `Calendar` and can exist only within it.
   - + [1] `Member` contain [0..*] `Boat` because `Boats` are registered by `Members`, and `Boats` are considered to be part of a `Member's` ownership.

3. **Inheritance Relationships:**
   - + `Member` extends `User` because a `Member` is a specific type of `User` that has additional attributes such as `paymentStatus` and `membershipFee`.
   - + `Treasurer` extends `User` because a `Treasurer` is another specific type of `User` that handles payment management.
   - + `Secretary` extends `User` because a `Secretary` is a specialized type of `User` responsible for managing club events and members' berths.
   - + `BoatType` is not mentioned in the Classes list, so we cannot define it here.
   - + `Receipt` does not extend any class because it is a standalone entity representing a document for payments.
   - + `Reminder` does not extend any class as it serves as a reminder object for dues and fees.
