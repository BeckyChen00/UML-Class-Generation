### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Identifying Associations:**
   - Members have a connection with Items, as they can lend and register items. Therefore:
     + [1..*] Member associate [0..*] Item because a Member can lend multiple Items, and an Item can be associated with multiple Members (for lending).
   - Members can receive Notifications regarding various system events. Therefore:
     + [1] Member associate [0..*] Notification because a Member can receive multiple Notifications, but a Notification is directed towards a specific Member.
   - The Administrator oversees the entire system, which includes managing Members and their Items. Therefore:
     + [1] Administrator associate [0..*] Member because an Administrator manages multiple Members, while each Member may be managed by one Administrator.
   - The Administrator also oversees Items, as they manage item listings. Therefore:
     + [1] Administrator associate [0..*] Item because an Administrator can manage multiple Items, while each Item can be overseen by one Administrator.
   - Each LendingContract is linked to Members as it involves borrowing and lending items between them. Therefore:
     + [1] LendingContract associate [1] Member because each LendingContract is created between one borrowing Member and one lending Member.

2. **Identifying Compositions:**
   - The StuffLendingSystem is composed of Members, Items, Notifications, and LendingContracts, as they are integral to its functioning. Therefore:
     + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] Member because the StuffLendingSystem can have multiple Members.
     + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] Item because the StuffLendingSystem can have multiple Items.
     + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] Notification because the StuffLendingSystem can generate multiple Notifications.
     + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] LendingContract because the StuffLendingSystem can have multiple LendingContracts.

3. **Identifying Inheritances:**
   - User is a base class for both Member and Administrator, as both share common attributes (username, password, email, phoneNumber, memberID, and dateOfCreation). Therefore:
     + Member extends User because a Member is a kind of User.
     + Administrator extends User because an Administrator is a kind of User.

4. **Checking for Incorrect Inheritances:**
   - There are no incorrect inheritances present as all inheriting classes are valid in the context of the given classes.

### Intermediate Reasoning Results

**Associations:**
1. + [1] Member associate [0..*] Item because a member can have multiple items registered in the system.
2. + [1] Member associate [0..*] LendingContract because a member can enter into multiple lending contracts.
3. + [1] Administrator associate [0..*] Member because an administrator can oversee multiple members.
4. + [1] Administrator associate [0..*] Item because an administrator can track multiple items listed in the system.
5. + [1] Member associate [1..*] User because each member is represented by exactly one user profile.
6. + [1] User associate [0..*] Notification because a user can receive multiple notifications.
7. + [1] Item associate [0..*] LendingContract because an item can be involved in multiple lending contracts.

**Compositions:**
1. + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [1..*] Member because the system must have at least one member to operate.
2. + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] Item because the system can hold zero or more items.
3. + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] LendingContract because the system can have zero or more lending contracts.
4. + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [1] DayCounter because the system has a day counter to track the current day.

**Inheritance:**
1. + User extends Member because a User is-a-kind-of Member.
2. + Administrator extends User because an Administrator is-a-kind-of User.
3. + Item extends StuffLendingSystem because an Item is-a-kind-of entry in the Stuff Lending System.

**Checking for Redundant Associations and Incorrect Inheritances:**
- Member does not extend User because they are distinct entities; hence, delete this inheritance.
- Item does not extend StuffLendingSystem because it is not a kind of system; hence, delete this inheritance.
- The other associations and inheritances maintain logical consistency and relevance in the context of the Stuff Lending System.

### Intermediate Reasoning Results

1. **Associations**:
   + [1] Member associate [0..*] Item because a Member can lend or register multiple Items.
   + [1] Member associate [0..*] LendingContract because a Member can enter into multiple Lending Contracts.
   + [1] Administrator associate [0..*] Member because an Administrator can manage multiple Members.
   + [1] Administrator associate [0..*] Item because an Administrator can track multiple Items.
   + [1] User associate [0..1] Member because a User profile is linked to a Member account.
   + [1] User associate [0..1] Administrator because a User profile can also represent an Administrator account.
   + [1] LendingContract associate [1] Member because each Lending Contract is linked to one borrowing Member.

2. **Compositions**:
   + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] Member because the Stuff Lending System manages multiple Members.
   + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] Item because the Stuff Lending System manages multiple Items.
   + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] LendingContract because the Stuff Lending System manages multiple Lending Contracts.
   + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..1] DayCounter because the Stuff Lending System keeps track of the current day count.
   + [1] StuffLendingSystem contain [0..*] Notification because the Stuff Lending System generates multiple Notifications.
   + [1] Administrator contain [0..*] Notification because an Administrator can send multiple Notifications.

3. **Inheritance**:
   + [Administrator] extends [User] because an Administrator is a kind of User with additional privileges.
   + [Member] extends [User] because a Member is a kind of User with specific roles in the system.
   + [LendingContract] does not extend [Item] because LendingContract is a distinct entity associated with transactions, not a type of Item, delete this inheritance.
   + [Notification] does not extend [User] because Notification is a separate entity meant for communication, not a type of User, delete this inheritance.
